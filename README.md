## Overview

Disruptor-cpp is a fully functional C++ port of the [LMAX disruptor](https://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/). 
Implements all the features available in java Disruptor v3.3.7.

## Building

### Compilers

* Clang 3.8 or newer
* GCC 5.0 or newer
* Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 or newer

### Linux

[Boost](http://www.boost.org/) must be available on your machine.  You can install it using your favorite package manager or build it on your own.
If [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) has been installed into standard system locations the following commands will start the build:   

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
make
```

If [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) has been installed into a custom location you will probably need to specify **BOOST_ROOT** variable. Please refer to the [Find boost](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/FindBoost.html) documentation for details.

If you want to install [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) and other dependencies through conan, run `conan install` inside your `build` directory prior to running `cmake`:

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
conan install ..
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
make
```

By default, Disruptor's `CMakeLists.txt` will try to use files generated by conan for CMake. If it does not exist, it will fall back to your standard boost installation. To disable conan, use the **DISRUPTOR_CONAN**
flag:

```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DDISRUPTOR_CONAN=OFF
```

Optionally you may want to compile and run the unit tests and benchmarks. The tests compilation is activated by means of **DISRUPTOR_BUILD_TESTS** flag: 

```sh
cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release -DDISRUPTOR_BUILD_TESTS=true
```

### Windows 

The simplest way to compile the library on Windows is to use the provided Visual Studio solution files:
* Disruptor-lib.sln - the solution only includes the library.
* Disruptor-all.sln - the solution includes the library, benchmarks and unit tests.

[Boost](http://www.boost.org/)  must be available on your machine. The  [**boost.props**](https://github.com/Abc-Arbitrage/Disruptor-cpp/blob/master/boost.props) file already included into the solution but you may need to modify the headers and libraries directory according to your boost location and folder structure.

## Getting started

To give you a taste of C++ disruptor let us consider a very basic example where the event is passed from producer to consumer. The event will carry a single long value:  

```Cpp
struct LongEvent
{
    long value;
};
```

The consumer will print the event value to standard output and also notify the publishing thread when everything is processed:

```Cpp
struct PrintingEventHandler : Disruptor::IEventHandler< LongEvent >
{
    explicit PrintingEventHandler(int toProcess) : m_actuallyProcessed(0), m_toProcess(toProcess)
    {}

    void onEvent(LongEvent& event, int64_t, bool) override
    {
        std::cout << "Event: " << event.value << std::endl;

        if (++m_actuallyProcessed == m_toProcess)
            m_allDone.notify_all();
    }

    void waitEndOfProcessing()
    {
        std::unique_lock<decltype(m_mutex)> lk(m_mutex);
        m_allDone.wait(lk);
    }

private:
    std::mutex m_mutex;
    std::condition_variable m_allDone;
    int m_toProcess;
    int m_actuallyProcessed;
};
```

Now we can wire all the things together:

```Cpp
    auto const ExpectedNumberOfEvents = 10000;
    auto const RingBufferSize = 1024;

    // Instantiate and start the disruptor
    auto eventFactory = []() { return LongEvent(); };
    auto taskScheduler = std::make_shared< Disruptor::ThreadPerTaskScheduler >();
    
    auto disruptor = std::make_shared< Disruptor::disruptor<LongEvent> >(eventFactory, RingBufferSize, taskScheduler);
    auto printingEventHandler = std::make_shared< PrintingEventHandler >(ExpectedNumberOfEvents);

    disruptor->handleEventsWith(printingEventHandler);

    taskScheduler->start();
    disruptor->start();

    // Publish events
    auto ringBuffer = disruptor->ringBuffer();
    for (auto i = 0; i<ExpectedNumberOfEvents; ++i)
    {
        auto nextSequence = ringBuffer->next();
        (*ringBuffer)[nextSequence].value = i;
        ringBuffer->publish(nextSequence);
    }

    // Wait for the end of execution and shutdown
    printingEventHandler->waitEndOfProcessing();

    disruptor->shutdown();
    taskScheduler->stop();
```
